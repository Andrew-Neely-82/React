# React Repo

## This repo is to help me learn how to use react

<br>

### Things I've learned doing this first react page

- React is fairly easy to use and so is the setup
- In react, you can build html containers in `.jsx` files
- because its built on JS, you can make html into variables and call them easily in the `.jsx` such as doing the following :

```
<Header />
<Navbar />
<Footer />

{/* and more! */}
```
- In VS Code, errors for certain components/containers will show in the terminal during compilation where you can click on them and go the file
